# Core Tripal API Docs

Uses doxygen to generate documentation based on our code comments. In the past we've used the Drupal API module but this approach would allow us to host the API docs directly on Github Pages. Additionally, there are some extensions to readthedocs for integrating doxygen generated documentation and would be ideal for both types of documentation to be able to be combined at some point.

This work is being started in a separate repository as a trial ground for tring this out.
